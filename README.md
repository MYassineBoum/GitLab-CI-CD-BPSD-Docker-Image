# GitLab-CI-BPS-Docker-Image
To use the image of my Spring Boot CRUD application, you can simply type the following command:
<br/><br/>
<code>docker pull myassineboum/gitlab-ci-pipeline:v1</code>
<br/><br/>
I've added container_scanning, it's a good practice because it helps reducing vulnerabilities and risks by analyzing container images.
<br/>
For caching, it's a way to speed up the CI process.
